      <p1>
        My name is <f>Omar Alabdalla</f>, I am a Junior Developer hoping to
        pursue a career in <f>Computer Science</f>.
        <br /> Coding languages I currently work with include{" "}
        <f>JavaScript, React, Java, C++, and Python</f>.
        <br />
        Areas of experience include <f>HTML</f> and <f>Web Development</f>,{" "}
        <f>RESTful</f> coding through Scratch and <br />
        <f>REST API </f>
        development, application development, and
        <f> CyberSecurity</f>. <br /> I currently am going to college part time
        to get a degree in computer science.
        <br /> I first began learning about coding in middle school with block
        coding through <f>Scratch</f>
        <br /> Although I enjoyed it I still believed that there had to be more
        to coding than block coding.
        <br /> I decided to learn <f>batch</f> development but this still didnt
        satisy me so I withheld my learning until High School.
        <br /> In High school I decided to take every programming class, and was
        able to learn the basics of <f>Web Development</f>.
        <br /> I also was able to learn the advanced aspects of <f>Java</f>{" "}
        which I applied to create a game.
        <br /> Although I learned a leading to senior year I still wasnt
        satisfied with my progress so I created my first project.
        <br /> When I was trying to think of what I might want to develop I
        could only think of one thing.
        <br />
      </p1>
      <p2>
        <f> A Discord Bot.</f> I began with no prior knowledge of coding outside
        of basic html programming and Java development.
        <br /> However this was the part that excited me the most since it was a
        whole new type of programming.
        <br /> I didn't have any specific due date nor any features I had to add
        all I had to do was make the bot.
        <br /> After asking a few friends what I should add to the bot I decided
        to add a feature to search weather in any zipcode.
        <br /> At first I thought this would be a simple mater but instead it
        ended up required a lot of high level knowledge.
        <br /> This led me to learn <f>RESTful</f> programming which I also
        learned how to use in relation to <f>Python</f>.
        <br /> From here I decided to take the Blue Valley Caps program which
        forced me to take on three major projects.
        <br /> The intention wasn't to finish all three but rather to get each
        one presentable with a finished product in mind.
        <br /> At the end of the semester you were then forced to present in
        front of the parents of all the students.
        <br /> This program taught me more than just programming however it also
        taught me professionalism in a workplace.
        <br /> After the program ended I was able to interview with{" "}
        <f>Mazuma Credit Union</f> to get an internship as a{" "}
        <f>Software Developer</f>.
        <br /> This internship gave me an understanding of the real professional
        environment and validated my desire to work in this field.
