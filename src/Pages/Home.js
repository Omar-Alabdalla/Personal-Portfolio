        Hello, my name is Omar Alabdalla! I am a Junior Developer pursuing a
        career in Computer Science. The coding languages I’ve work with include
        JavaScript, React, Java, C++, and Python. My areas of experience include
        HTML and Web Development, RESTful coding through Scratch and REST API,
        application development, and Cybersecurity. I currently attend college,
        pursuing my degree in Computer Science. I first started learning about
        coding in middle school with block coding through Scratch. I enjoyed my
        time with it and so I continued from there into more advanced forms of
        coding. I went on to learn a bit of batch development until I started
        High School, from which I went on to take every programming class I
        could. I was able to learn some Web Development also some advanced parts
        of Java which I had then applied to creating my own game. Having learned
        a lot up to senior year I was eager to learn more so I went on to start
        my next major project. After intense brainstorming of ideas for a
        befitting project I came to one conclusion, a Discord Bot.

        I began with no prior knowledge of coding outside of basic html
        programming and Java development. However, this was the part that
        excited me the most since it was a whole new type of programming. I
        didn't have any specific due date nor any features I had to add all I
        had to do was make the bot. After asking a few friends what I should add
        to the bot I decided to add a feature to search weather in any zip code.
        At first, I thought this would be a simple mater but instead it ended up
        required a lot of high-level knowledge. This led me to learn RESTful
        programming which I also learned how to use in relation to Python. From
        here I decided to take the Blue Valley Caps program which forced me to
        take on three major projects. The intention wasn't to finish all three
        but rather to get each one presentable with a finished product in mind.
        At the end of the semester, you were then forced to present in front of
        the parents of all the students. This program taught me more than just
        programming however it also taught me professionalism in a workplace.
        After the program ended, I was able to interview with Mazuma Credit
        Union to get an internship as a Software Developer. This internship was
        able to round out my skills really well to teach me professionalism as
        well as programming in the workplace.
